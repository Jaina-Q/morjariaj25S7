        <h4>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h4>

        <p>Dear Eileen,

            Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.<br>
            <br>
            Starting dates<br>
            <br>
            We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:<br>
            <br>
            First semester: 9 September 2016<br>
            Second semester: 15 January 2017<br>
            Third semester: 2 May 2017<br>
            <br>
            Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.<br>
            <br>
            You can find more information about important university dates on our website.<br>
